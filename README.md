# Rock-Scissors-Paper Game

This is the completed version of my submission to the challenge. I created the app in Django with the usual Python and wrote the 
templates/pages with HTML/CSS and a bit of JavaScript(AJAX). For the most part, I'm pretty happy with the outcome. I'm pretty new to 
Django so there were a few things I had to brush up on for this project. I still haven't gotten around to diving into JavaScript so the 
JavaScript I did write is fairly limited. With some more time, I would have liked to change how the forms were submitted to the server as 
I think my method could be improved on. Furthermore, the AJAX I used simply checked for server changes and refreshed the entire page when
needed. A more elegant solution would update individual elements instead of reloading the whole page.

The select page is http://.../rps/ when running the Django dev server.
