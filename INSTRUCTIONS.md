# Rock-Scissors-Paper Game

## Problem Statement
As part of the software challenge, you'll need to implement this popular game in 2-player mode. Each player should be presented a form where they can make a choice between the three available options. Once the player makes their choice, they should be directed to a game status page. For each player the status can be one of the following four:

1. Other player has not made their choice yet
2. You won the game (other player has made a choice of X)
3. You lost the game (other player has made a choice of Y)
4. The game resulted in a tie (other player has made the same choice as yours)

## Implementation Details
We'd like this to be implemented as a web application. You are free to implement it using a web development framework of your choice. Depending on your area of expertise you may choose to implement the front end component, the back end component or both. For example, if you are a full-stack generalist or back end developer with some basic HTML knowledge, you may choose to implement the entire functionality of the game. If you are only familiar with Frontend / UI, we'd expect to see something impressive for the user interface.

If you choose an event-driven framework like Meteor or ReactJS, it'd be nice if the status page would reflect the actual status of the game without the need for refreshing. For example, once the first player makes their choice, they would be directed to the status page with the outcome #1. Once the second player follows up with their choice, the status page of player 1 will be automatically updated to one of #2 - #4.

## Bonus
To gain extra credit, consider implementing persistent game score. In other words, every time the two players play a game, the score is adjusted the same way as in chess (1 point for a win, 0 points for a loss, 1/2 point for a draw). The score should be present at all times on both the choice selection and the game status pages.

Good luck!
